I pulled my phone but to call who? My girlfriend an hour away? I needed to communicate but my mind was racing. I drank my coffee rapidly and the symptoms faded. As I felt better, I opened my laptop right there in the airport and started prototyping this app. It wasn't about the coffee anymore; in that fraction of 'Aura' time, all we look for is a way to speak up.",
