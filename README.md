> **"When I cannot speak, Aura speaks for me."**
>
> _This app was born from a moment of helplessness. I had a near seizure while eating a sandwich and coffee at the airport in Medellin. Suddenly, it hit me. I lost my ability to speak. I pulled out my phone, but to call who? My girlfriend, an hour away? I needed to communicate, but my mind was racing. I drank my coffee rapidly, and the symptoms faded. As I felt better, I opened my laptop right there in the airport and started prototyping this app. It wasn't about the coffee anymore; in that fraction of 'Aura' time, all we look for is a way to speak up._

**A simple, life-saving seizure diary and assistant. It alerts, logs, and speaks for you when you can't.**

* `router`: dedicated `AppRouter` for screen management.
* `contexts`: State management via React Context (UI, Theme).

### 🛡️ Quality Assurance

* **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipeline runs `npm test` and `npm run build` on every Pull Request.
