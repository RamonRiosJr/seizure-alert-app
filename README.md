> **"When I cannot speak, Aura speaks for me."**
>
> _This app was born from a moment of helplessness. I had a near seizure while eating a sandwich and coffee at the airport in Medellin. Suddenly, it hit me. I lost my ability to speak. I pulled out my phone, but to call who? My girlfriend, an hour away? I needed to communicate, but my mind was flooded with thousands of thoughts and déjá vus, unable to find the word 'seizure'. I drank my coffee rapidly, and the symptoms faded slightly, stabilizing me. All I needed in that moment was a **Button** to press so others could identify what was happening and help me._

**A simple, life-saving seizure diary and assistant. It alerts, logs, and speaks for you when you can't.**

* **One-Tap Help:** Just press the big red button if you feel a seizure coming.
* **Safe:** You have to slide to cancel, so you don't call by accident.
* **Loud Alert:** It flashes the screen and makes a loud noise to get people's attention.
* **Automatic Call:** If you don't stop it, it calls your emergency contact automatically after 30 seconds.

### 🏥 Helping the Helpers (Bystanders)

* **Talks for You:** The phone speaks out loud, telling people exactly what to do (like "Turn them on their side").
* **Works Offline:** Even if you have no internet, the voice instructions still work.
* **Medical Info:** Shows your Name, Blood Type, and Allergies on the screen.

### 🤖 "Aura" - Your AI Helper

* **Ask Questions:** "Aura" is a smart assistant inside the app.
* **Voice or Text:** You or a helper can ask questions like "What do I do safely?" using your voice.
* **Note:** Aura needs an internet connection to work.

### ⚙️ Easy to Install (PWA)

* **No App Store Needed:** You can install this directly from your browser.
* **iPhone & Android:** Works on almost any phone.
* **Manual Install Button:** Go to **Settings** > **App Installation** to see a big "Install" button or instructions for your phone.

### 📡 New: Tap-to-Alert (NFC)

* **Instant Start:** You can program a cheap NFC tag (sticker) so that simply _tapping_ your phone to it starts the alarm immediately. Great for bedside tables!
