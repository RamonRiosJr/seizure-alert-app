# Project Roadmap: Aura Speaks AI

This document outlines the strategic technical progression and prioritized objectives for the Aura Speaks AI platform, focusing on clinical-grade reliability, regulatory compliance, and architectural excellence.

## 🛡️ Phase 1: Stability & Compliance (Immediate Priorities)

High-priority items focused on safety-critical requisites and regulatory readiness (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, CE Mark/FDA guidelines).

- [x] **Secure API Integration**: Implemented a client-side guided setup ("Bring Your Own Key" model) with automated validation to ensure zero-cost infrastructure and maximum privacy.
- [x] **Precision Battery Telemetry**: Integrated discharge rate tracking and Wake Lock API to guarantee sensor continuity during monitoring.
- [x] **Localization (i18n) Hardening**: Standardized all UI and telemetry strings for multi-language support (English/Spanish).
- [ ] **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implementation of strict meta tags to mitigate XSS risks and enforce secure resource loading.
- [ ] **Global Error Boundary**: Top-level crash recovery UI to ensure "Safe Mode" availability during unexpected failures.

## 🏗️ Phase 2: Architectural Excellence

Enhancing the scalability, maintainability, and quality assurance thresholds of the platform.

- [ ] **Test Coverage Expansion**: Targeted increase of unit and integration test coverage from ~60% to **80%+**, focusing on complex hardware hooks.
- [ ] **Architectural Documentation**: Technical deep-dives utilizing Mermaid diagrams for data-flow visualization (Sensor Data → Hook Processing → Local Storage → Alert Dispatch).
- [ ] **CI/CD Hardening**: Integration of Husky and lint-staged to enforce architectural standards at the commit level.
- [ ] **Automated Accessibility Checks**: Integration of Lighthouse CI to maintain "A" grade WCAG compliance.
- [ ] **Settings UI Modularization**: Refactor the monolithic Settings view into a tabbed/hub-based architecture for improved scannability and future-proofing.

## ✨ Phase 3: Strategic Feature Set

Expansion of the platform's utility as a comprehensive medical-grade assistant.

- [ ] **Bio-Hands-Free Activation**: Voice-triggered ("Hey Aura") alert activation for users with significant motor control limitations.
- [ ] **Wearable Integration**: Synchronized monitoring for Apple Watch and WearOS to leverage wrist-based PPG and accelerometer data.
- [ ] **Clinical Dashboard**: Anonymized data visualization layer for seizure history and biometric trends to facilitate doctor-patient consultations.
- [ ] **Offline Synchronization UI**: Enhanced visual feedback for PWA service worker status and asset updates.

## 🏥 Phase 4: Clinical Ecosystem & Caregiver Loop

Developing Aura into a holistic management platform for patient and caregiver synchronization.

- [ ] **Smart Medication Management**:
  - Offline-first medication schedules with high-priority "Critical Window" alarms.
  - Intelligent snooze and escalation protocols for missed doses.
- [ ] **Clinical Calendar Integration**:
  - Secure tracking of specialist appointments with automated pre-appointment biometric summaries.
- [ ] **Caregiver Alert System**:
  - Multi-channel notifications (Push, Email, SMS) for missed medication or emergency triggers, utilizing a secure, privacy-preserving bridge.
- [ ] **Proactive AI Reminders**:
  - The Aura AI assistant shifts from reactive (answering questions) to proactive (reminding of upcoming triggers or appointments based on historical trends).
